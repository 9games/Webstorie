      "heading": "What is Climate Change?",
      "text": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases.",

      "heading": "The Driving Forces Behind the Shift",
      "text": "The burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other potent greenhouse gases, intensifying the planet's warming trend.",
